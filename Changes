1.00    2008-05-26
	* ==> Changed internal storage of what's mixed in to what ... Previously would only 'remember' one method per class.  Did away w/the constructed key as well. Now it's a hashref that's {srcClass}->{destClass} = [ {}, {}, ... ] where the array is an AoH with info (including symbol) on each mixin'd method.
	* DESTROY wasn't functional (multiple reasons) -- refactored to include bug fixes, and to support interal change.
        * Added t/mixin-to.t
        * Added t/mixin-from.t
        * Added t/boilerplate.t
	* added t/destroy-to.t
	* added t/destroy-from.t
	* added t/errors.t
	* added t/import.t
	* 90% coverage
        * pod updates (SYNOPSIS, "Desctructor" typo, HISTORY, AUTHOR, OVERVIEW, SYNOPSIS)
	* changed here-doc to q{} for style and hoping it resolves perl 5.10 test failures
